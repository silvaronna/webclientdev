# JavaScript & TypeScript Variable Declaration Examples

This repository contains examples demonstrating the difference between `let` and `const` in both **JavaScript** and **TypeScript**. The structure is organized to help beginners understand variable declaration, scope, and usage in practical scenarios.

## ✅ Purpose

- Understand when to use `let` vs `const`
- Learn differences in declaring variables in JavaScript and TypeScript
- Practice working with common use cases: math operations, string manipulation, and date differences

## 📌 Highlights

- `const` is used when the variable's value should not change.
- `let` is used for variables whose value might be reassigned.
- TypeScript adds static type checking for safer and more predictable code.

## 💡 Example Use Cases

- Calculating circle area and circumference
- Finding the third angle of a triangle
- String initial extraction (e.g., from full name)
- Difference between two dates in days
