<h1> Week II </h1>
    <p>In this file, im creating a code to: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Converting Farhenheit to Celcius</li>
          <li>Converting Kilometer to Centimeter or Vice Versa</li>
          <li>Find out whether a number is even or odd</li>
          <li>Removing letters in a string</li>
          <li>Finding out is a string palindrome or not</li>
        </ul>
    <p>
      I'm write this code by using function with switch case to help me in achieving the main goal of this assignment. This assignment can help me in understanding JavaScript programming language style which will be very useful to build my algorithm ability to jump higher to reach the dream.
